This project contains the code for Kismet gameplay. 
There is code available to simulate a single-player
kismet game with the computer, or to play human vs. 
computer. The code is contained in the 'kismet_engine'
directory. The other directories contain data generated for 
later analysis, some tex documentation, and the beginnings 
of an attempt to improve the AI.
